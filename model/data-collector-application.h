 * \brief This application is installed on a node where something is observed, possibly processed
 * and sent to an AgentApplication.
 *
 * Instances of this class do not send any data if they are not registered at a callback. To send
 * data this class should be inherited by a class which is registered at a callback and which sends
 * data received from the callback. In the child class, a custom method should be created and
 * registered at a callback to make sure it is regularly called. This method's signature has to
 * conform to the signature expected by the callback. The purpose of the custom method is to be able
 * to process data received from the callback and specify to which ChannelInterfaces it shall be
 * sent. Therefore, in the end of the custom method, \c Send() should be called with the according
 * data and InterfaceIds. If the data shall be sent to all ChannelInterfaces, the overloaded \c
 * Send() method without specifying InterfaceIds should be called.
