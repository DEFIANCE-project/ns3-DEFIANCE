 * \class ObservationApplication
 * \brief This application is installed on a node where observations occur.
 *
 * Instances of this class do not send any data if they are not registered at a callback. To send
 * observations this class should be inherited by a class which is registered at a callback and
 * which sends data received from the callback as observations. In the child class, a method like
 * \c Observe() should be created and registered at a callback to make sure it is regularly called.
 * This method's signature has to conform to the signature expected by the callback. The purpose of
 * \c Observe() is to aggregate data received from the callback into an observation and specify to
 * which ChannelInterfaces it shall be sent. Therefore, in the end of the \c Observe() method,
 * \c Send() should be called with the according observation and InterfaceIds. If the observation
 * shall be sent to all ChannelInterfaces, the overloaded \c Send() method without specifying
 * InterfaceIds should be called.
